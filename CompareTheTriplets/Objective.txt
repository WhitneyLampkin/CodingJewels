Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. A reviewer rates the two challenges, awarding points on a scale from 1 to 100 for three categories: problem clarity, originality, and difficulty.

We define the rating for Alice's challenge to be the triplet A = (a0, a1, a2), and the rating for Bob's challenge to be the triplet B = (b0, b1, b2).

Your task is to find their comparison points by comparing a0 with b0, a1 with b1, a2 and b2 with .

If a(i) > b(i), then Alice is awarded 1 point.
If a(i) < b(1), then Bob is awarded 1 point.
If a(i) = b(i), then neither person receives a point.
Comparison points is the total points a person earned.

Given A and B, can you compare the two challenges and print their respective comparison points?

Input Format

The first line contains 3 space-separated integers, a0, a1, and a2, describing the respective values in triplet A. 
The second line contains 3 space-separated integers, b0, b1, and b2, describing the respective values in triplet B.

Constraints

	1 <= a(i) <= 100
	1 <= b(i) <= 100

Output Format

Print two space-separated integers denoting the respective comparison points earned by Alice and Bob.

Sample Input

5 6 7
3 6 10

Sample Output

1 1 

Explanation

In this example:

	A = (a0,a1,a2) = (5,6,7)
	B = (b0, b1, b2) = (3,6,10)

Now, let's compare each individual score:

a0 > b0, so Alice receives 1 point.
a1 = b1, so nobody receives a point.
a2 < b2, so Bob receives 1 point.

Alice's comparison score is 1, and Bob's comparison score is 1. Thus, we print 1 1 (Alice's comparison score followed by Bob's comparison score) on a single line.
